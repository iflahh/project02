          <h4>What Exactly it is?</h4>
          <p class="content">A collection of strong technologies called the MERN Stack is used to
            create scalable master web applications that include backend,
            frontend, and database components. Full-stack web applications can
            be developed more quickly and simply using JavaScript. MERN Stack is
            an approachable full-stack technology in which JavaScript frameworks
            are used for creating applications and dynamic websites.<br />The
            MERN Stack is made up of four key parts or four primary
            technologies:<br />
            <b>MongoDB:</b> NoSQL (Non-Structured Query Language) Database
            System, mostly used for creating document databases.<br />
            <b>Express:</b> It is primarily used for Nodejs web framework
            development.<br />
            <b>React:</b> It is a popular client-side framework. the JavaScript
            framework<br />
            <b>NodeJs:</b> It is the initials utilized to create the most
            effective JavaScript web server.<br />
            These four technologies all have a significant role in giving
            developers a complete framework. Even these four technologies
            significantly impact the creation of web applications. Let us
            understand the MERN stack components.
          </p>
          <h4>Mern Stack Components</h4>
          <p class="content">
            The MERN stack is made up of four elements. Let's talk about each
            one separately.<br />
            1. MongoDB is the first component, a NoSQL database management
            system.<br />
            2. ExpressJs is the second component of the MERN stack. It is a
            NodeJS backend web application framework.<br />
            3. The third component is ReactJs, a JavaScript library used to
            create user interfaces (UIs) based on UI components.<br />
            4. NodeJs make up the MERN stack's last component. Because it is a
            JavaScript runtime environment, JavaScript code can be executed
            outside of a browser.<br />
            Let us discuss them in detail one by one.

              <h3 class="uppercase cursive h3">Mongo DB</h3>
              <p class="content">
                Data is saved in documents with key-value combinations that
                resemble JSON objects in MongoDB, a NoSQL database management
                system. Databases, schemas, and tables can all be created by
                users using MongoDB. It provides the Mongo shell, which has a JS
                interface for changing, querying, and removing records.<br />The
                reasons to use MongoDB over others are mentioned below:<br />
                <ul class="content" style="list-style-type: disc">
                  <li>Documents are simple to index because the database is document-oriented. Hence, a quicker reaction.</li>
                  <li>By splitting up big data into smaller chunks, multiple machines can handle it.</li>
                  <li>The biggest benefit is that MongoDB makes use of JavaScript.</li>
                  <li>Any type of data in a separate document under a schema-less structure.</li>
                  <li>Data stored as Objects, Object Members, Arrays, Values, and Strings in JSON</li>
                  <li>It's very simple to use JSON syntax.</li>
                  <li>A variety of browsers supports JSON.</li>
                  <li>It is simple to share data of any size and type (video, audio).</li>
                  <li>Setting up MongoDB is very simple, thanks to the simple environment setup.</li>
                  <li>MongoDB supports a flexible document model (tables, schemas, columns, and SQL) that is quicker and easier.</li>
                </ul>

              <h3 class="uppercase cursive">Express Js</h3>
              <p class="content"> An ExpressJs framework for NodeJs makes it easier to write backend code. By doing so, you can avoid making extra Node modules. ExpressJS provides a variety of middleware to maintain the accuracy of the code.  <br> The reasons to use ExpressJs over others are mentioned below:<br>
                <ul class="content" style="list-style-type: disc">
                  <li>Single-threaded and async.</li>
                  <li>scalable, quick, and efficient</li>
                  <li>has the most active Node community.</li>
                  <li>With its integrated router, js Express encourages code reuse.</li>
                  <li>Solid API</li>

              <p class="content">
                User interfaces for mobile apps and SPAs can be created using the JS library ReactJs. You may create UI components and code JavaScript with it. Virtual DOM is used across the entire JS framework.<br>The reasons to use ReactJs over others are mentioned below:<br>
                <ul class="content" style="list-style-type: disc">
                  <li>A virtual DOM object is a representation of an actual DOM object. The virtual DOM is a duplicate of the real DOM. The entire user interface must re-render the virtual DOM whenever the web application is modified. After comparing the differences between the original DOM and this virtual DOM, changes are made by the original DOM.</li>
                  <li>React makes use of an HTML/XML JavaScript Extension. helps to make writing React components simpler and easier.</li>
                  <li>ReactJS is compatible with components. The fundamental units of a user interface (UI), each component has a purpose and contributes to the whole. Additionally, these elements encourage code reuse and simplify the overall web application.</li>

              <p class="content">
                An open-source JavaScript runtime environment called NodeJs enables users to execute code on the server. Users can choose from a large number of node modules or packages thanks to the inclusion of node package management or npm. Node can run code faster because it was created using the Chrome JavaScript Engine.<br>The reasons to use NodeJs over others are mentioned below:<br>
                <ul class="content" style="list-style-type: disc">
                  <li>JavaScript Runtime Environment, which is free to use.</li>
                  <li>Following a single-threaded model is known as single threading.</li>
                  <li>Data Streaming Quickly: Node.js, based on the JavaScript Engine in Google Chrome, has quick code execution.</li>
                  <li>Very Scalable.</li>

          <h4>Why Choose MERN Stack?</h4>
          <p class="content">
            Utilizing the MERN Stack is beneficial for numerous reasons. For instance, utilizing JavaScript and JSON, it enables the development of a three-tier architecture with a database, frontend, and backend.<br>The MERN stack's primary database, MongoDB, is built with native support for storing JSON data. JSON and JS were used to build everything in it, including the CLI and query language. The NoSQL database management system integrates nicely with NodeJS, enabling the manipulation, representation, and storage of JSON data at every application tier.<br>It is available in a form called MongoDB Atlas, which makes database management even simpler by providing an auto-scaling MongoDB cluster on any cloud provider with only a few clicks.<br>A server-side framework called Express makes it simple to map URLs to server-side operations by wrapping HTTP requests and responses. This is a perfect complement to the front-end JS framework ReactJS, which is used to create interactive HTML UIs that interact with the server.<br>Data flows seamlessly between the two technologies because they are JSON-compatible, allowing for quick development and simple debugging. One language, JavaScript, and the JSON document structure are all you need to comprehend the system as a whole.
